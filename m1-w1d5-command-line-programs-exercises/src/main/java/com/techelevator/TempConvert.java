 The Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula is:
 	Tc = (Tf - 32) / 1.8
 	where 'Tc' is the temperature in Celsius, and 'Tf' is the temperature in Fahrenheit
 	
 The Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion formula is:
 	Tf = Tc * 1.8 + 32
 	
 Write a command line program which prompts a user to enter a temperature, and whether its in degrees (C)elsius or (F)arenheit.
 Convert the temperature to the opposite degrees, and display the old and new temperatures to the console.
  
 $ java TempConvert
 Please enter the temperature: 58
 Is the temperature in (C)elcius, or (F)arenheit? F
 58F is 14C.
 
 Note why Tf - 32 above is enclosed in parentheses with a comment inside your code. You'll feel better for it, 
 and will start building some good programming habits while you're at it.
