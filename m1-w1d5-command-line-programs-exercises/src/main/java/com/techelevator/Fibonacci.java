 The Fibonacci numbers are the integers in the following sequence:  
	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
 By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
 
Write a command line program which prompts the user for an integer value and display the Fibonacci sequence leading up to that number.

  
 $ java Fiboncci
 
Please enter the Fibonacci number: 25
 
 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
